# PDtool

This is a standalone tool that can view the raw JSON of integrations found in your account, trigger some pre-canned events, and view/ack/resolve open incidents.

## How to use

* index.html is standalone - enter a v2 API token and a valid PD user id on the Authentication tab and the rest of the tabs will start working.
