# PDvis

This is a standalone tool, also suitable for use as a PagerDuty add-on, that aims to show some useful visualizations of PagerDuty activity over time.

## How to use

* Construct a URL like so:
```
https://martindstone.github.io/PDvis/index.html?token=XXXX
```
* replacing XXXX with a valid v2 PagerDuty API token (read-only is fine)
