# Users not On-call

This tool allows you to see which users in your PagerDuty account are never listed as being on-call in any of your schedules or escalation policies

## Usage

Create an add-on within PagerDuty with the following URL:

```
https://pagerduty.github.io/addons/user_not_oncall/index.html
```

On the add-on you can simply enter your subdomain and a v1 API token to display the users not on-call in your account
